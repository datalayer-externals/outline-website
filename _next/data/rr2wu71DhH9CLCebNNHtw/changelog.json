is the biggest release of Outline since we first published the source code. The [editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) is entirely rebuilt from the ground up for extensibility and speed, allowing us to move faster than ever before and is the culmination of more than 4 months of planning and work.\r\n\r\nThe improvements and fixes are almost too numerous to count, but the most important are listed below:\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Document rendering performance increased by leaps and bounds, some of our extreme test documents went from 30seconds -> 300ms to render\r\n- A new menu for inserting blocks is much more intuitive than before, type \"/\" at the beginning of a line or hit the \"+\" button to trigger\r\n\r\n![Outline block menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/380914/82714444-676a8f00-9c43-11ea-99f3-c89b6536c10b.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Updating a document's title now also updates any links to the document in other docs automatically\r\n- \"Highlight\" now appears as an option in the formatting menu\r\n- It's now possible to type a url in markdown formatting\r\n- Quotes are converted to smart quotes as you type\r\n- Support for paragraph breaks in list items\r\n- It's now possible to choose the \"system\" theme and have Outline follow your system's dark mode preference – this is especially useful on macOS when dark mode is set to \"auto\" to go dark in the evenings.\r\n\r\n![Outline appearance preference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/380914/82713920-8a943f00-9c41-11ea-9f32-ce381b90f1c3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Support for alternative input methods, this finally brings the fix for typing in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and all other languages that use a soft keyboard for input.\r\n- Restored the ability to disable embeds on a single doc in the context menu\r\n- Fixed some extra scrollbars that appear depending on your input device\r\n- It's now possible to save a document with only a title\r\n- Long titles now wrap onto multiple lines again\r\n- Document headings are centered correctly again when scrolled\r\n- Adding a new row to a table now respects column alignment\r\n- Improved key handling in link editor\r\n- Issues with markdown shortcuts surrounded in whitespace not applying"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/outline/outline/releases/25417617","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/outline/outline/releases/25417617/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/outline/outline/releases/25417617/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/outline/outline/releases/tag/v0.42.2","id":25417617,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI1NDE3NjE3","tag_name":"v0.42.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.42.2","draft":false,"author":{"login":"tommoor","id":380914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDkxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/380914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor","html_url":"https://github.com/tommoor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommoor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-04-11T16:47:52Z","published_at":"2020-04-11T17:52:57Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/outline/outline/tarball/v0.42.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/outline/outline/zipball/v0.42.2","body":"###
